## Overview

Django News Aggregator is a web application that gathers news articles from various RSS feeds, analyzes their content, clusters similar articles, and presents them in an organized manner. The project uses Django, a high-level Python web framework, to build a user-friendly interface for browsing categorized and clustered news articles.

## Features

* **RSS Feed Processing:** Collects news articles from local websites with RSS feeds using Python libraries like feedparser.
* **Content Analysis:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract keywords, topics, and sentiments from news articles.
* **Clustering:** Groups similar articles using clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.
* **Categorization:** Defines categories based on the type of news articles using classification algorithms.
* **Database Management:** Stores processed data in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval.
* **Web Application:** Implements a front end in Django with a user interface similar to Google News.
* **User Interface Features:** Provides features for filtering and sorting news articles based on user preferences.
* **Regular Updates:** Sets up a scheduler to fetch new RSS feeds, update the database, and periodically re-cluster and re-categorize articles.
